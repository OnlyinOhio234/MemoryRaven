### 🔧 Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Process

### 1. Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/MemoryRaven.git
cd MemoryRaven

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ravenbadbihh/MemoryRaven.git

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install in development mode
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

### 2. Development Workflow

```bash
# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make your changes
# ... edit files ...

# Run tests
pytest

# Run linting
make lint

# Commit your changes (will run pre-commit hooks)
git commit -m "feat: add new memory consolidation strategy"

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Open a pull request
```

### 3. Testing

We use pytest for testing. Please write tests for any new functionality:

```python
# tests/test_your_feature.py
import pytest
from memory_empire import MemoryEmpire

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_your_feature():
    empire = MemoryEmpire("test-agent")
    # Test your feature
    result = await empire.your_new_method()
    assert result == expected_value
```

### 4. Documentation

- Update docstrings for any new functions/classes
- Update README.md if adding new features
- Add examples to the `examples/` directory
- Update API documentation if changing public APIs

## Style Guidelines

### Python Style Guide

We use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting and [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting.

```bash
# Format code
black .

# Run linter
ruff check .

# Type checking
mypy memory_empire
```

### Code Style

- Use type hints where possible
- Write descriptive docstrings for all public functions
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use meaningful variable names
- Follow PEP 8 conventions

### Commit Messages

- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc)
- `refactor:` Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
